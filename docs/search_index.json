Took me a while to learn it, so why not share it. Main features: data structure for simple loading and handling of data statistical analysis for proteomics data functional enrichment via clusterProfiler tidyverse friendly ggplot2, for publication-quality figures plotly, for interactive data exploration R Markdown, for efficient communication "],["acknowledgements.html", "Acknowledgements", " Acknowledgements This R package was developed at the University of Ottawa in the lab of Dr. Maxim Berezovski and working with Dr. Zoran Minic, Core Facility Manager and Biological Mass Spectrometrist of the John L. Holmes Mass Spectrometry Facility. Both have given me the necessary challenges and freedom to try and learn approaches to various problems addressed by modern MS-based proteomics, and put the results together in this R package. Initial collections of data analysis functions I used throughout my Masters program have been superseded by this package. My first undergraduate student Abdullah Khraibah motivated me to write functions comprehensible to others which ultimately led to much better code and reproducibility in my own work. Last but not least, long before I used the tidyverse or R Markdown for the first time, Daniel Torka, a friend and fellow student from Darmstadt, recommended both to me, which I dismissed at that time. Now, both are integral parts of my everyday work and I feel very stupid. Thanks Junior!

These and further articles, tutorial, etc. will be referenced throughout the handbook where informative. Have fun!

For this, we need the R programming language and statistical environment, RStudio, the most commonly used code editor for R, and finally a bunch of R packages, collections of readily available functions written by the R community. You can find a comprehensive introduction to those past here. 1.2 Learn R Basics While there are many introductions to R out in the internet like R for Data Science, the swirl package, some introductions from Modern Dive, and other resources you can find on the official website of the bookdown package, this chapter might be filled with tips that help users getting start coding in R. 1.3 Project management with Git and GitHub In principle, we have enough tools at hand to get start with out analysis.

Install it as any other program. It is important to install R before RStudio. 2.2 Install RStudio Download the desktop version of RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. This is the program in which you will interact with the R language and conduct all your analyses. 2.3 Install others To install packages from GitHub, you need RTools. Install RTools from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. 2.4 Install R packages R packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones.1 (Available CRAN Packages By Name)[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html] 2.5 Install R Bioconductor packages Install devtools using install.packages(\"devtools\").
