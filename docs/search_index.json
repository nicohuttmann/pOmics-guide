This is my attempt to summarize what I learned about proteomics data analysis in R. It took me a while to learn it, so why not share it. Main features: data structure for simple loading and handling of data statistical analysis for proteomics data functional enrichment via clusterProfiler tidyverse friendly ggplot2, for publication-quality figures plotly, for interactive data exploration R Markdown, for efficient communication "],["acknowledgements.html", "Acknowledgements", " Acknowledgements This R package was developed at the University of Ottawa in the lab of Dr. Maxim Berezovski and working with Dr. Zoran Minic, Core Facility Manager and Biological Mass Spectrometrist of the John L. Holmes Mass Spectrometry Facility. Both have given me the necessary challenges and freedom to try and learn approaches to various problems addressed by modern MS-based proteomics, and put the results together in this R package. Initial collections of data analysis functions I used throughout my Masters program have been superseded by this package. My first undergraduate student Abdullah Khraibah motivated me to write functions comprehensible to others which ultimately led to much better code and reproducibility in my own work. Last but not least, long before I used the tidyverse or R Markdown for the first time, Daniel Torka, a friend and fellow student from Darmstadt, recommended both to me, which I dismissed at that time. Now, both are integral parts of my everyday work and I feel very stupid. Thanks Junior!

These and further articles, tutorial, etc. will be referenced throughout the handbook where informative. Have fun!

For this, we need the R programming language and statistical environment, RStudio, the most commonly used code editor for R, and finally a bunch of R packages, collections of readily available functions written by the R community. You can find a comprehensive introduction to those past here. 1.2 Learn R Basics While there are many introductions to R out in the internet like R for Data Science, the swirl package, some introductions from Modern Dive, and other resources you can find on the official website of the bookdown package, this chapter might be filled with tips that help users getting start coding in R. 1.3 Project management with Git and GitHub In principle, we have enough tools at hand to get start with out analysis.

Install it as any other program. It is important to install R before RStudio. 2.2 Install RStudio Download the desktop version of RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. This is the program in which you will interact with the R language and conduct all your analyses. 2.3 Install R packages R packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones.1 Available CRAN Packages By Name Install the tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/) via install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Next, we will download two more packages, which will help us install even more R packages from sources other than CRAN. install.packages(c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;BiocManager&quot;)) 2.4 Install R from Bioconductor Install Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/) via BiocManager::install(c(&quot;clusterProfiler&quot;, &quot;org.Hs.eg.db&quot; &quot;UniProt.ws&quot;)) 2.5 Install R packages from GitHub and others Another important source of R packages is GitHub. GitHub is not just the place where most R packages are being developed before they are put to repositories such as CRAN or Bioconductor, many other packages including the pOmics packages can be installed from it. :) Lets do it: devtools::install_github(&quot;nicohuttmann/pOmics&quot;) Last but not least, there are some other sources for R packages which will be exemplified by the disgenet2r package to query the DisGeNET database for gene disease associations. devtools::install_bitbucket(&quot;ibi_group/disgenet2r&quot;) https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide "],["version-control-with-git-and-github.html", "Chapter 3 Version control with Git and GitHub 3.1 Basic update of data 3.2 Common problems", " Chapter 3 Version control with Git and GitHub Happy Git and GitHub for the useR 3.1 Basic update of data Add files: git add . 3.2 Common problems 3.2.1 Too large files Original post of the answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17890278. Download the BFG Repo-Cleaner jar file bfg-x.xx.x.jar (e.g. bfg-1.14.0.jar) from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/. Place the file in the directory of your R project, the same of the .git folder. Open the terminal in this folder (e.g. via RStudio &gt; Git &gt; Shell) Type in the terminal: java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M The file name bfg.jar must match the name of your jar file and the file size limit can be changed (e.g. 50M for 50 ) If you do not encouter an error, type: git gc --prune=now --aggressive to clean the dead data. If you encounter the following error Warning : no large blobs matching criteria found in packfiles - does the repo need to be packed?, refer to this post https://stackoverflow.com/q/61769785 and type git gc prior to step 4. 3.2.2 .gitignore does not instantly work Just do: git rm -r --cached . git add . git commit -m &quot;Drop files from .gitignore&quot; "]]
