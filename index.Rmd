# Preface {-}
This is my attempt to make proteomics data analysis in R accessible to other scientists. Took me a while to learn it, so why not share it.


Main features:

* data structure for simple loading and handling of data
* statistical analysis for proteomics data
* functional enrichment via [clusterProfiler](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/clusterProfiler/) 
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) friendly
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), for publication-quality figures
* [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), for interactive data exploration
* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), for efficient communication
